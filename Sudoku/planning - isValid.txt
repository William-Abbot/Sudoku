
• A “square” refers to one of the 81 boxes in the sudoku grid, each of which is to be filled eventually
with a digit from 1 to 9.

• A “block” refers to a 3 × 3 sub-block of the main puzzle in which all of the numbers must appear
exactly once in a solution. We will refer to a block by its columns and rows. Thus block ghi456
includes the squares g4, g5, g6, h4, h5, h6, i4, i5 and i6.

• A “candidate” is a number that could possibly go into a square in the grid. Many methods we will
examine will eliminate candidates one after the other until there is a unique number that can go in
a square.

• Sometimes an argument will apply equally well to a row, column or block, and to keep from having
to write “row, column or block” over and over, we may refer to it as a “virtual line”. A typical use
of “virtual line” might be this: “If you know the values of 8 of the 9 entries in a virtual line, you can
always deduce the value of the missing one.” In the 9 × 9 sudoku puzzles there are 27 such virtual
lines.

• Sometimes you would like to talk about all of the squares that cannot contain the same number as
a given square since they are in the same row, column, or block. These are sometimes called the
“buddies” of that square. For example, you might say something like, “If two buddies of a square
have only two possible candidates, then you can eliminate those as candidates for the square.”




I need to define each of these as either a data type or a class.
